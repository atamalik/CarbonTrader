| Credits Traded (Tonnes) | Price Per Tonne (USD) | Total Price (USD) |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 80,933.07             | $25.00                    | $204,729.18       |

Explanation:

Based on the information provided, I propose buying up to 80,933.07 tonnes of carbon credits to offset 197,220.26 tonnes CO2e for CONSTELLATION BRANDS, INC. (Beverages). The price per tonne is set at $25.00, which falls within the budget of $1,643,502.16. This price takes into account the default risk of 0.25%, and I believe it provides a reasonable balance between cost and environmental impact.

The total price for the proposed carbon credit purchase is $204,729.18. This amount represents a significant reduction in emissions compared to the original CO2e output of 197,220.26 tonnes, and it also helps to mitigate the potential risk associated with default.

Please note that this proposal is based on the information provided, and any changes to the initial parameters may affect the final price and quantity of carbon credits purchased.
