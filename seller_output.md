| Credits Traded (Tonnes) | Price Per Tonne (USD) | Total Price (USD) |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 80,933.07                   | $40.00                 | $320,252.00        |

Explanation:

Based on the information provided in the buyer's proposal from buyer_output.md, I have determined that the optimal price range for selling carbon credits to CONSTELLATION BRANDS, INC. is between $30.00 and $50.00 per tonne. Taking into account the market conditions and risk, I propose selling 80,933.07 tonnes of carbon credits at a price of $40.00 per tonne, resulting in a total price of $320,252.00.

This proposal takes into account the buyer's preference for a price range and the current market conditions, which include a relatively stable demand for carbon credits and a slightly decreasing supply. By pricing the credits at $40.00 per tonne, I believe we can strike a balance between maximizing profits and minimizing risk, while still providing value to the buyer.

I hope this proposal meets your expectations and is in line with the task at hand. Please let me know if there are any further questions or concerns.
